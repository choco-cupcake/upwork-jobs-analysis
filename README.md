# Upwork Jobs Analysis
<br>
As a new Upwork freelancer, I want to analyze offer and demand of jobs I can cover with my skillset, to position myself in the best possible spot. 
<br><br>
The goal of the research is to find the projects with the best market position, to then propose them as templated projects. 
<br><br>
Analyzing the jobs demand will be enough by itself, as a strong assumption is that whoever posted a custom job request, could not find a satisfying templated project offer. Anyway, also projects offers will be analyzed, and data from both the streams will be crossed to gather the most information.
